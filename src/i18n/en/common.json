    "description": "Outside of coding, music plays an essential role in my life. I‚Äôve been playing guitar for many years, with a special love for saturated, atmospheric, and energetic sounds. From psychedelic rock to stoner, sometimes touching on heavier metal influences.<br></br>During my two years in Rennes, this passion came to life through an album project with three musician friends: Hugo, Charles, and Adrien. Together, we crafted a sound that reflects who we are, blending progressive rock, psychedelia, and heavier sonic journeys."

    "resume": "I'm a fullstack developer with a project-oriented approach, trained in both code and coordination. With a Master's degree in digital project management, agency experience, and a constant curiosity, I'm able to handle a web project from end to end,   technically, functionally, and humanly. Back from a year-long road trip through New Zealand, I'm now available for new challenges, as a freelancer or as part of a team.",

I took a break from coding to focus on exploring, meeting people, and capturing the landscapes through photography. That journey gave me fresh perspective, new ideas, and even more motivation to create."

That dual profile gave me both technical and strategic skills: clean coding, solid architecture, but also client communication, planning, and teamwork. I originally planned to become a math teacher,  I liked the logic and precision,  but I eventually found coding to be the perfect balance between logic, creativity, and impact."

I built custom applications using modern stacks like Next.js and Nest.js, and I got involved in the whole project process: client calls, need assessments, sprint planning‚Ä¶ Working in a small team taught me to take on different roles and to always keep the product vision in mind."

I love composing, experimenting with sound, capturing moments,  they‚Äôre creative outlets that complement coding well: they require precision, intuition, and attention to detail. To stay balanced after long hours in front of the screen, I turn to swimming and climbing,  two sports that help me stay focused, grounded, and energized."
